# DemandForecaster
## Introduction
The goal of this Notebook is to demonstrate the concept of Demand forecast using linear models, non linear supervised time series forecasting models, Keras driven Feedforward neural networks.
The measure for the efficiency of the model is the R2 score, MAPE, MSE and RMSE comparison.
