# DemandForecaster
## Introduction
The goal of this Notebook is to demonstrate the concept of Demand forecast using linear models, non linear supervised time series forecasting models, Keras driven Feedforward neural networks.
The measure for the efficiency of the model is the R2 score, MAPE, MSE and RMSE comparison. 
## Facebook Kats and Prophet
  Facebook created a model called Prophet for time series forecasting. Along with that recently Facebook open sourced Kats framework which encompasses Prophet, and host of other statistical time series forecasting models. This notebook uses Facebook's Kat Framework and will also use Keras for Neural Nets. 
## Uber's Ludwig Low Code ML Framework
Uber Open sourced their ML Framework named Ludwig which aims to automate most of model tuning (Hyper parameter tuning) model selection and AutoML capabilities. We will also be using these models to do an Ensemble approach (Bagging) for selecting efficient models. More on Uber's Ludwig is available here
